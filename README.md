# Soil-Carbon-Debt
R code and spatial predictions for WHRC-TNC project modeling spatial extent of soil carbon loss due to agriculture

Raster files of predictions are organized by folder:

OCD = Organic carbon density (kg C m-3) for 0, 30, 100 and 200 cm depths predicted at various years

SOCS = Soil organic carbon stocks (Mg C ha-1) for 0-30, 0-100 and 0-200 cm depths predicted at various years

abs_error = Absolute error in prediction of OCD (kg C m-3) at 0, 30, 100 and 200 cm depths
